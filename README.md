<h1>🗒️Description of the project</h1>

<h3>This application is an advanced todo list that, unlike other similar projects, contains many details that can be used to plan tasks for the next month.</h3>

<h3>⚠️Caution: Due to the many details, this application can only be used in the desktop view and is not responsive for tablets and mobile phones.</h3>

<h1>⚙️Some features of this application</h1>

<h3>In this application, you can add a start date and deadline for each project so that you can consider a time period for doing your task if needed.</h3>

<h3>To record more details about each task, you can consider description for it.</h3>

<h3>If you recorded wrong information about any work or if you intend to change them for any reason, you can edit them at any time and you will not need to delete and create again.</h3>

<br>

<h1>🟠To use this application better, please pay attention to the following points:</h1>

<h3>Please set the start date and deadline to the same date if you want to do something in one day.</h3>

<h3>If you want to do something today, use the "today" button to automatically set the date to today, no need to use the calendar.</h3>

<h3>Try to use the calendar to set the date, but if you want to set it manually, make sure you don't choose a date before today, otherwise you will get an "expired date" error.</h3>

<h3>If you enter the date manually, be careful not to enter the last day of the month by mistake, because in this case you will get an "invalid date" error.</h3>

<h3>Entering the title as well as the start date and deadline for each task is necessary, but you can leave the description blank.</h3>

<h3>Due to limited space, please avoid long titles and instead add more details in the description.</h3>
